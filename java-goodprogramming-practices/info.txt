Indicators for saying a program is good
 1 - correctness

    Separate logic from code (move to different class or function)
    Data type over flows 
        Use long and  double instead of int and float

 2 - effeciency
    
    Use access modifiers like public & static if only required and also use final when you don't want to change any variable.
    Use BufferdReader and BufferdWriter
    Try to avoid object creation

3 - debuggability 

    Use good variable names
    Avoid global variable declaration
    use almost all possible builtin functions
